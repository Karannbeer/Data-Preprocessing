Data preprocessing Web app   

Data preprocessing, a component of data preparation, describes any type of processing perforemd on raw data to prepare it for another  data processing procedure. Data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that is more easily and effectively 
processed in data mining, machine learning and other data science tasks. 
To make the process easier, data preprocessing is divided into four stages:
Data cleaning
Data Reduction 
Data Integeration
Data Transformation
